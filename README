Tk::Peapod version 0.01
======================

Tk::Peapod is a Perl/Tk widget for displaying POD 
in your Perl/Tk applications.

The tarball includes a script called 'peapod',
which is a simple POD viewer script.

Yes, there are other POD viewers available on CPAN,
and I recommend you use them for viewing POD.
Peapod will eventually (hopefully) support some
features that extends POD beyond its standard definition.

Stay tuned.
