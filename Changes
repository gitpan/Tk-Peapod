0.01  Thu Mar 13 22:40:57 2003
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.22 with options
		-X -n Tk::Peapod
	- this is a non-working version.
	- can view minimal POD documents,
	- no new functionality added yet.

0.02	- links are blue and cause mouse pointer to change to an arrow.
	- clicking an internal link actually goes to that part of document.

0.04	- Generate Table of Contents based on =head1, etc headers
	-	make TOC have subparagraphs, such as 3.2.4 and similar
	- Insert TOC numbers in POD view so a printout of TOC and POD
	-	would actually be something semi-useful.
	- Redesign widget as a composite widget of 2 ROText in a frame
	-	separated by an Adjuster widget.
	- Left ROText will eventually hold TOC
	- Right TOText holds POD viewer.
	- saving now because finally got the composite widget to work right.
	-	it wasn't easy, and it'll probably get massaged in future.
